Version 1.1 not released
- (planned) renamed tool to bazsc
- (planned) renamed "scbaz" subdirectory to "meta"
- (planned) when installing packages, the decompressor
            refuses to overwrite files
- (planned) the package installer ignores files in the meta/
            directory; these will be used later for in-package
            information about the package itself.

Version 1.0 released on 2005-11-5
- basic functionality complete
