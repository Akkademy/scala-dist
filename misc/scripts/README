These are the runner scripts for sbaz.

They were generated by the ScalaTool ant task, except that
it does not allow to set the TOOL_CLASSPATH variable correctly.

what we need is:
 TOOL_CLASSPATH="$SCALA_HOME/lib/sbaz.jar:$SCALA_HOME/misc/sbaz/scala-library.jar"

when adding the classpath attribute to the ScalaTool call, the
generated classpath will always be prefixed by the current $SCALA_HOME,
i.e. what we get is:
 TOOL_CLASSPAHT="/home/rytz/...."

To re-create these scripts, run "ant toolScriptsGen" and correct
the TOOL_CLASSPATH.
