<h1>Hacking Scala Using Ant</h1>

<p><em>It would be nice to finish this one day, but it is just a sketch so far.
Additionally, maybe people should use maven instead of ant.... </em>

<p>Ant (LINK) is a tool for managing the conversion of source code
into built programs that is particularly popular among those who work
with Java.  This file describes how to use Ant with Scala code.

<h2>Approach to Dependencies</h2>

<p>Scala Bazaars allows distributing both complete applications and
individual libraries.  It helps you obtain and manage packages from
world-wide shared repositories, from others in your organization, and
from code on your own machine.  You may as well use it to handle
dependencies between portions of your own project.

<p>The general approach, then, is that when you build something and
are ready to use it, you should install it in your own sbaz directory
for use by other tools.  If you want others in your organization or
around the world to also use the package, then post your package on an
appropriate sbaz index server.  If you are compiling something that
has a dependency, find that dependency in your sbaz directory.  This
way, components can be developed independently and then
inter-component dependencies can be managed by sbaz.


<h2>Preliminaries</h2>
<p>To locate your sbaz directory, your <code>build.xml</code> file
should start with a definition of the <code>scala.home</code>
property:
<blockquote>
<pre>
  <!-- set scala.home to your local sbaz-managed directory -->
  <property name="scala.home" value="${user.home}/sbaz"/>
</pre>
</blockquote>

It is also convenient to define a current version number for the code
being built:

<blockquote>
<pre>
  <property name="version" value="0.2"/>
</pre>
</blockquote>

Finally, it is important to include the standard Ant header supplied
along with the Scala compiler.  

<blockquote>
<pre>
  <taskdef
      resource="scala/tools/ant/antlib.xml">
    <classpath>
      <pathelement location="${scala.home}/lib/scala-compiler.jar"/>
      <pathelement location="${scala.home}/lib/scala-library.jar"/>
    </classpath>
  </taskdef>
</pre>
</blockquote>


Documentation on these tasks can be found at:  (LINK)

<h2>Directory layout</h2>

<p>There is no one right way to lay out a directory tree.  A common
layout for Scala programmers, assumed for the rest of this article,
goes like this:

<ul>
<li><code>build</code> - All built files go into this directory.
    It is especially important with ant that all built files go into 
    a separate directory, because Ant does not otherwise make it easy
    to implement a "clean" target.

<li><code>src</code> - The Scala source code.  You should arrange it
    so that the subdirectory structure corresponds as closely as
    possible to the package structure of your code, because various
    Scala tools use the directory layout as a heuristic.  For example,
    a class named <code>sbaz.keys.Key</code> should be located at
    <code>src/sbaz/keys/Key.scala</code> if possible.  If you are
    compiling multiple jars, then <code>src</code> should have
    a subdirectory for each jar you are compiling.


<li><code>tests</code> - A JUnit test suite for your code.  This is
    arranged just like <code>src</code>, but is probably not included
    in the distributed program.

<li><code>docs</code> - Any documentation you have for your project.

<li><code>examples</code> - Any code you have that is related to the
    project but is not part of the main jar(s) you are building.  It
    is good to keep such code in the directory tree of the project it
    is part of, but you also do not normally want to put it in
    <code>src</code>.
</ul>



<h2>Targets</h2>

<p>The following are some targets it makes sense to define in your
<code>build.xml</code>:
<ul>
<li><code>build</code> - builds Scala code into jars
<li><code>dist</code> - builds sbaz packages
<li><code>install</code> - installs sbaz packages
<li><code>clean</code> - deletes all built files
<li><code>toolScripts</code> - build scripts
                       to run your code from a command line
<li><code>tests</code> - builds your SUnit tests into a jar
<li><code>api</code> - runs scaladoc across sources to produce
                       API documentation
</ul>

<p>These targets are described one by one below with an example given
of each.

     people can download and play with??  Even if I do not send the

     right...  -->
