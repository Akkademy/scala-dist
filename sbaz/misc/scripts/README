These are the runner scripts for sbaz.

They were initially generated by the ScalaTool ant task; however additional
logic that is sbaz specific has been added.

Windows does not allow files that are already open and used by an application
to be moved or deleted.  This interferes with sbas's ability to upgrade itself.
To work around this, sbaz will leave the current file alone and install the
updated version next to it with an additional '.staged' suffix.  Both the
Windows .bat and bourne shell script (cygwin) need to complete the installation
after the JVM has exited and is no longer using the sbaz dependant JAR files.
it does not allow to set the TOOL_CLASSPATH variable correctly.

Presently, there are only two JAR files managed by sbaz that sbaz also depends
upon.  These can bee seen in the TOOL_CLASSPATH defined in the script:
 TOOL_CLASSPATH="$SCALA_HOME/misc/sbaz/sbaz.jar:$SCALA_HOME/misc/sbaz/scala-library.jar"

If the need arises to re-create these scripts (e.g. a bug fix in the script
template that sbaz could benifit from), run "ant toolScriptsGen" and manually
add the sbaz specific post-JVM-exit logic to the end of the script.
