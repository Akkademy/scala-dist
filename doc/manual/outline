do it in docbook, i guess.  can't live without an HTML version,
and there may as well be a nice for-print version, too.

overview and philosophy
getting started
concepts
  universe, managed directory, package, package advertisement
universe definitions - simple, compound...
command reference

  



what is a PU:
  analogous to apt, the eclipse plugin system, yum, ... :
  it allows grabbing 

  each client operates within one universe at a time; it is called
  a universe because it is the totality of packages that the manager
  sees.
  it's a little bubble universe of packages; those inside operate
  happily oblivious to the rest of the multiverse


getting started
  tell them to extract a tarball
  then give commands, just like in the tutorial....




obtaining packages from a package universe
    - choose a directory where the packages will be extracted

    - run XXX to initialize the directory with the universe you are
      interested in for that directory.  for example, here is how
      you access the standard scala exchange universe

    - run XXX to see a list of available packages

    - run XXX to install a package of your choice and pull in dependencies

    - run XXX to remove a package

    - see man page for more details
      (actually, it should surely be inlined in the reference??)


key management
    - key management:  all requests potentially require a key

    - key-making keys are extraordinarily powerful.  normally, people
      heading the project use these to give permissions to new people.

    - in general, requires a key, though this is not deployed yet even though
      it's in the protocol

    - commands related to keys:
      add to client
      create new key
      revoke key on server


posting packages
    - post the code somewhere on the internet (repository is future work)

    - make the XML file...

    - post it...

    - retract old versions eventually...
