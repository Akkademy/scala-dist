<p>Be aware there is a great Eclipse plugin (LINK) for Scala.  You
probably want to use that if you are doing serious Scala development.
There is also Emacs support, available in the
<code>scala-tool-support</code> package via sbaz, but Eclipse offers
much more functionality.

Mostly you can just use Eclipse and go if you are using sbaz.
However, one tip is that it is helpful to set a SCALA_HOME variable,
analagous to the scala.home property used within normal Java code that
interacts with sbaz.  You can set it XXX and you can use it in
classpaths as a "variable" entry.  (LINK)  This is also useful for making
source attachments.
